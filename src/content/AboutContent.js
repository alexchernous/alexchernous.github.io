      <h4>Who I am</h4>
      <p>I like technology, my name's Alex Chernous.</p>
      <h4>What I want to do</h4>
      <p>Ultimately I'd like to build and deliver products for people who want to
        use them. If any contribution I provide helps make the final product
        easier and/or more enjoyable to use, that's a win. I value the user
        experience and am most happy when I'm in an environment that values the same.</p>
      <h4>Where I want to do it</h4>
      <p>I'm primarily looking to grow my career in Software Engineering.</p>
      <p>My personal interests and educational background have contributed to my
        interest in AI and/or NLP related engineering. However, as this webpage suggests,
        I have no problem exploring other technical areas as well.</p>
      <p>My first job out of university gave me an opportunity to work in
        the AI and NLP field as a UX Conversational Designer (experience and
        responsibilities outlined in Resume).
        This position fit nicely with my Linguistics background.
        As time went on it also gave me a chance to display my
        Computer Science knowledge by acting as an Application Developer on
        similar types of projects that I designed.</p>
      <p>Receiving this experience opened my eyes to two important areas of the
        field and made me appreciate the intricacies of the development
        process as a whole.</p>
      <h4>Personal interests</h4>
      <p>Science fiction is my main area of interest in almost any media -
        books, movies, games etc. I'll always have a sweet spot for
        space, robots, aliens, and technology.</p>
      <p>A close second is ancient history and civilizations. If you're in the same boat,
        then I definitely recommend checking out Graham Hancock's
        Fingerprints of the Gods.</p>
      <p>Also video games!</p>
