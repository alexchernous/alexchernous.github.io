      <h4>What I want to do</h4>
      <p>I want to engineer products for people who want to
        use them. If any contribution I provide helps make the final product
        easier and/or more enjoyable to use, that's a win. </p>
      <h4>Where I want to do it</h4>
      <p>I want to work in an environment that values the user experience as much as I do.</p>
      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p>My first job out of university gave me an opportunity to work in
        the AI and NLP field as a UX Conversational Designer (experience and
        responsibilities outlined in Resume).
        This position fit nicely with my Linguistics background.
        As time went on it also gave me a chance to display my
        Computer Science knowledge by acting as an Application Developer on
        similar types of projects that I designed.</p>
      <p>Receiving this experience opened my eyes to two important areas of the
        field and made me appreciate the intricacies of the development
        process as a whole.</p>
