      <h4>What I want to do</h4>
      <p>I want to engineer products for people who want to
        use them. If any contribution I provide helps make the final product
        easier and/or more enjoyable to use, that's a win. </p>
      <h4>Where I want to do it</h4>
      <p>I want to work in an environment that values the user experience as much as I do.</p>
      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p>My first job out of university gave me an opportunity to work in
        the AI field as a UX Conversational Designer where I designed
        various chatbot solutions for multiple fortune 500 clients.</p>
      <p>As time went on it also gave me a chance to display my
        Computer Science knowledge by acting as an Application Developer on
        similar types of projects that I designed.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I decided to commit to the technical side of things
        and transferred internally to a full time Software Engineer role to help the SaaS team
        build our Customer Service AI Platform.</p>
      <p>Receiving this experience opened my eyes to multiple important areas
        of the field and made me appreciate the intricacies of the development
        process as a whole: From various technological complexities to
        collaboration with a wide array of teams and talent.</p>
