### What I want to do

**Ultimately I'd like to build and deliver products for people who want to use them.** If any contribution I provide helps make the final product easier and/or more enjoyable to use, that's a win. I value the user experience and am most happy when I'm in an environment that values the same.

### Where I want to do it

I'm primarily looking to grow my career in **Software Engineering**.

My personal interests and educational background have contributed to my interest in AI and/or NLP related engineering. However, as this webpage suggests, I have no problem exploring other technical areas as well.

My first job out of university gave me an opportunity to work in the AI and NLP field as a UX Conversational Designer (experience and responsibilities outlined in Resume). This position fit nicely with my Linguistics background. As time went on it also gave me a chance to display my Computer Science knowledge by acting as an Application Developer on similar types of projects that I designed.

Receiving this experience opened my eyes to two important areas of the field and made me appreciate the intricacies of the development process as a whole.

### Personal interests

Science fiction is my main area of interest in almost any media - books, movies, games etc. I'll always have a sweet spot for space, robots, aliens, and technology.

A close second is ancient history. If you're in the same boat, then I definitely recommend checking out Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods.

Also video games!
