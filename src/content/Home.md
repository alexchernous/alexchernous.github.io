## What's this?

This website acts as my portfolio. I built it using common JavaScript frameworks and hosted it on github for easy access.

## What did I use?

I put this together with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap.js](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Most of the components you see (buttons, headers, links etc.) are Bootstrap ([react-bootstrap] (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)) with the exception of the login page. If you'd like to see my own styling done from scratch please refer to the Login button at the top right of the screen.
