## What's this?

This website acts as my portfolio. I built it using common JavaScript frameworks and hosted it on GitHub for easy access.

## What did I use?

#### Frameworks
I put this together with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap.js](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Most of the components you see (`buttons`, `headers`, `links` etc.) are Bootstrap ([react-bootstrap] (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)) with the exception of the login page.</br>If you'd like to see my own styling done from scratch please refer to the **Login** button at the top right of the screen.

## Short explanation of pages

<dl>

  <dt>Home</dt>
    <dd>This Home page component acts as a little introduction and outline.</dd>

  <dt>Projects</dt>
    <dd>Projects page is a component designed to hold <a href="https://github.com/alexchernous" target="_blank">my github</a> activities.</dd>

  <dt>Resume</dt>
    <dd>In Resume you'll find my up to date CV.</dd>

  <dt>About me</dt>
    <dd>About me will give a brief summary of my interests and passion as it relates to my field of study and work.</dd>

  <dt>Login</dt>
    <dd>The login page is a pseudo working signin for my website that showcases <code>state</code> and <code>prop</code> usage within React.</br>If you enter a dummy name and password, your name will appear at the top of the banner replacing "anonymous". The button will be replaced with a Logout equivalent.</br>It also demonstrates my own styling (no Bootstrap). But in most cases I'd leave the styling to UI designers, because I'm definitely not strong in that respect.</dd>
