### What's this?

This website acts as my portfolio. I built it using common JavaScript frameworks and hosted it on GitHub for easy access.

### What did I use?

<p>I put this together with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap.js</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the components you see (<code>buttons</code>, <code>headers</code>, <code>links</code> etc.) are Bootstrap (<a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" target="_blank">react-bootstrap</a>) with the exception of the login page.</br>If you'd like to see my own styling done from scratch please refer to the <b>Login</b> button at the top right of the screen.</p>

##### About me
About me will give a brief summary of my interests and passion as it relates to my field of study and work.

##### Login
The login page is a pseudo working signin for my website that showcases `state` and `prop` usage within React. If you enter a dummy name and password, your name will appear at the top of the banner replacing "anonymous". The button will be replaced with a Logout equivalent. It also demonstrates my own styling (no Bootstrap). But in most cases I'd leave the styling to UI designers.
