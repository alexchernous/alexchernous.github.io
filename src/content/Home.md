### What's this?

This website acts as my portfolio. I built it using common JavaScript frameworks and hosted it on GitHub for easy access.

### What did I use?

<p>I put this together with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React.js</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap.js</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the components you see (<code>buttons</code>, <code>headers</code>, <code>links</code> etc.) are Bootstrap (<a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-bootstrap</a>) with the exception of the login page.</br>If you'd like to see my own styling done from scratch please press the <b>Login</b> button at the top right of the screen.</p>

### What are the pages about?

##### Home
This 'Home' page component acts as a little introduction and outline.

##### Projects
<p>'Projects' page is a component designed to hold some of <a href="https://github.com/alexchernous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my GitHub</a> activities.<p>

##### Resume
In 'Resume' you'll find my up to date CV.

##### About me
'About me' will give a brief summary of my goals and interests as it relates to my career.

##### Login
The 'Login' page is a pseudo working signin for my website that showcases React concepts such as `state` and `prop`. If you enter a dummy name and password, your name will appear at the top of the banner replacing "user". The button will be replaced with a Logout equivalent. It also demonstrates my own styling (no Bootstrap). But in most cases I'd leave the styling to UI designers.
