    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>A project, in its infancy, to map free parking streets of Toronto.
    </p>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>
      The city, espeically downtown, can be a nightmare for cars and parking.
      So I wanted to tackle this problem - there's similar apps on the PlayStore
      today, but this is my approach. Moreover, this was a great way to play
      around with Google APIs.
    </p>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>Android Studio (Kotlin), Google Maps / Places APIs.
    </p>
  </React.Fragment>
);

export default ParkMeContent;
