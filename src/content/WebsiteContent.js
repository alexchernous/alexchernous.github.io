    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      This webpage you're on was put together to demonstrate web concepts
      (e.g. responsive design), technology understanding (e.g. JS / React),
      and act as my personal portfolio.
    </p>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>
      Having a place on the internet that removes itself from social media sites
      is freeing. You can create your own content & style as well as demonstrate
      your skills while doing it.
    </p>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>
      React, Bootstrap, Material UI and other libraries
      that can be found in package.json on GitHub.
    </p>
  </React.Fragment>
